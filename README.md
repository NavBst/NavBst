# Hey there!👋I'm Navneet Bisht

##About Me
I'm **full-stack web developer** who loves building awesome apps and cool stuff. I love diving into both frontend and backend (frontend mainly though),
making things look good *and* work smoothly. If you're lookin for someon who's always up for learning new tech and solving problems (or causing them),
you're in the right place!

### **Teck Stack I Love:**
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.js, TailwindCSS (because who doesn't love styling wihtout the headache?)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VsCode

### **Currently Learning:**
- More advanced React patterns to level up my app building
- Performance optimization - because speed matters! 🏎️
- Next.js to extend my area of expertise
